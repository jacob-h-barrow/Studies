    "# Asyncio High-Level Review\n",
    "- Writing concurrent code using the async/await syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coroutines and Tasks\n",
    "    - Thing we strive to make async/await\n",
    "    - Needs an entry-point: asyncio.run() -> top-level main\n",
    "\n",
    "- Awaitable: things with an await dunder\n",
    "    - Three types: coroutines, Tasks, Futures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coroutine definition\n",
    "    1. A function: async def signature\n",
    "    2. Object: returned by calling a coroutine function\n",
    "\n",
    "- Future: low-level awaitable object which represents an eventual result of an async op\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods of Interest\n",
    "    - Creating Tasks\n",
    "        1. asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None, context=None)\n",
    "            - If a reference isn't saved, a fire and forget could lose the task\n",
    "        2. asyncio.TaskGroup -> context manager way\n",
    "            - Downside: waits for all tasks in the group to finish\n",
    "            - *Downside/Plus: early exits don't raise the asyncio.CancelledError exception, tons of exceptions to this rule!!\n",
    "                - Due to this, managing through create_task is better/more granular!\n",
    "    - Running Tasks\n",
    "        1. asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=None, loop_factory=None)\n",
    "        2. class asyncio.Runner(*, debug=None, loop_factory=None)\n",
    "            - Ways to operate\n",
    "                - run(coro, *, context=None)\n",
    "                - close()\n",
    "                - get_loop()\n",
    "            - Notes\n",
    "                - Runner uses the lazy initialization strategy, its constructor doesnâ€™t initialize underlying low-level structures\n",
    "                - Embedded loop and context are created at the with body entering or the first call of run() or get_loop()\n",
    "                - Installs a custom signal.SIGINT handler before any user code is executed and removes it when exiting from the function\n",
    "        3. [Within an asyncio function] awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, return_exceptions=False)\n",
    "            - Same as creating tasks number 2: dont do it. This way you don't have to use shielding\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Waiting\n",
    "        1. The asyncio.timeout() context manager is what transforms the asyncio.CancelledError into a TimeoutError \n",
    "        2. async asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout)\n",
    "        3. asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, timeout=None) -> returns an iterable\n",
    "            - Async iterator supplied\n",
    "            - Avoid if possible as the task completion makes it difficult \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Introspection\n",
    "        1. asyncio.current_task(loop=None) -> returns the currently running Task instance, or None\n",
    "        2. asyncio.iscoroutine(obj) -> returns bool\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level Task Object\n",
    "- class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None, context=None, eager_start=False)\n",
    "- A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not threadsafe!\n",
    "- Used to run coroutines in event loops\n",
    "    - If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future\n",
    "    - When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes\n",
    "- Special low-level awaitable obj that represents an eventual result of an async op\n",
    "    - Needed for callback-based code used with async/await\n",
    "- asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception()\n",
    "- Some methods: done(), result(), get_name(), set_name(value), cancel(msg=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Event Loop\n",
    "- Event loops use cooperative scheduling (on Task at a time)\n",
    "- Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions.\n",
    "- add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Addition\n",
    "- Call Graph Introspection (3.14)\n",
    "- asyncio.to_thread(...)\n",
    "- asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(...)\n",
    "- Low-Level Futures and Event Loop (good for tail tracking of a file)\n"
